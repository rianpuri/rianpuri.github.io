                ABOUT ME <br>
                ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br> <br>
                I am currently a senior at the Shri Ram School Moulsari, Delhi NCR, studying the science stream. <br><br>
                 My subjects are Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science and English in the ISC <br>(Indian Secondary Certificate) curriculum.
                 <br><br>
                 My interests include Data analysis, Statistics, engineering and Computer Science. <br><br>
                  <br>

                 WHAT I'M UP TO <br>
                 ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br> <br>

                 Over the past 4 years, I have written several research papers, worked at an internship, and <br> volunteered many hours at a shelter
                 (You can find out more about these under the projects tab). <br> <br>

                 These days, however, with the recent developments in COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns, you can <br> find me helping my colony's 
                 Residents Welfare Association, playing video-games, or learning the guitar.
                <br><br><br>
